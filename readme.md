## Backend

The backend of the Order Management System is built using Node.js and Express. It handles order management, pagination, and interacts with a MongoDB database to store order data. Additionally, it provides APIs for listing business orders.

### Pagination

The backend includes pagination functionality for listing orders. Pagination parameters such as `page` and `limit` can be specified in API requests to control the number of results returned. This allows for efficient retrieval of large datasets.

## API Documentation

You can find the API documentation for this project [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/17842680/2s9YJZ5R4f). It provides detailed information on the available endpoints for order listing and management.

## Deployment

To deploy the app to a live server, follow these steps:

1. Set up a production-ready server environment with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

2. Deploy the backend code to a Node.js hosting service (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Azure) and configure the necessary environment variables.

3. Set up a production-ready MongoDB database and update the database connection details in the backend environment variables.
